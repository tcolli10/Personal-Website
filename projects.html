                    This project is an implementation of the stack class.
                    A stack is an abstract data structure in which data is added
                    and removed from the top.
                    I built this class two different ways, once using an array, and once 
                    with a linked list. This class has built in functions to do various 
                    opperations to the stack. The most notable fucntions are the ability to push
                    and pop items from the stack.

                    This project is an implementation of the queue class.
                    A queue is an abstract data structure in which 
                    the first item added will be the first item removed.
                    I also built this class using two different methods.
                    The first method used a circular array to store my data,
                    while the second used a linked list. This class also has
                    built in function to enqueue and dequeue items.

                    This project is an implementation of the binary search tree 
                    and Tree Node classes.
                    A binary search tree is an abstract data structure in which
                    a parent node must be greater than it's left child and less than
                    it's right child. For this project I created a tree and node class, 
                    then created functions that can manipulate trees. Some built in functionalities
                    of this class is the ability to insert nodes, search for nodes, find common traversals
                    of the tree, and more.

                    This project is an implementation of the max heap class.
                    A max heap is an abstract data structure in which 
                    each node is greater than both of its children.
                    A max heap must also be an almost complete tree.
                    The heap class that I build uses an array to store
                    it's data. Some of the built in functionalities of my
                    heap class are the ability to create a heap given a list of keys,
                    add and remove items, and sort a list in acseding order using the
                    heapsort algorithym.

                    For this project, I was provided with a large codebase that I then refactored 
                    in an object oriented manner. This refactoring included creating new classes for each 
                    entity in the world and creating a higherarchy of abstract classes to reduce code 
                    duplication and improve functionalilty. I also replaced the simple pathing algorithym that 
                    was intially in use with my implementation of the a-star algorithym to improve the functionalilty.
