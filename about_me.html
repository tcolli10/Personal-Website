                My name is Tyler Collins and I am a second year 
                Computer Science Major at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.
                I grew up in Morro Bay, California,
                about fifteen minutes from where I now attend school.
                I enjoy spending time in nature and exploring the natural 
                beauty of our world. I had my first expeirience coding in middle school
                and have since found a passion for the craft. I have learned so much about
                coding since I began my educational career at Cal Poly and each day I find 
                myself excited to learn more.
