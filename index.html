                Welcome to my website! <br>
                I built this webiste from scratch using html and css.
                This website functions as a way for me to put the web development skills
                I have learned to action. So far I have experience coding in Python, doing object oriented coding
                and design in Java, and working with Linux. On this website you can find some of the projects I have worked on as well as a little 
                about me and my goals.
